Chess Rules

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid.
Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.

The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape.
